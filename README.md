# procmodl
My current testbed to mess about with some SDF based procedural modeling stuff, only this time it's public

/prÉ”k m(É™)dÉ›l/ sounds kinda cool, so that'll be how I say it. Why not.


(Fair warning if anyone tries to look in here: I'm more concerned with experimenting with interesting techniques and languages than writing a good application. I'm really only keeping this public for a friend, do not expect high quality anything. Peace ðŸ‘‰ðŸ˜ŽðŸ‘‰)
